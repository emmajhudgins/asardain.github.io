	I am a PhD candidate in Brian Leung's lab at McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada. <br><br> 

I use computational methods to study the ecology,impacts, and management of invasive species at the macroecological scale. <br><br>
	
	I am interested in uncovering broad generalities that emerge across species in spite of their idiosyncrasies, as a consequence of anthropogenic processes.<br><br>
	
	My current study system is United States forest pests, where human transport (via firewood and analogous mechanisms) leads to unexpected predictive ability across all species simultaneously.

	I have built ecological models for invasive forest pest dispersal, establishent, and associated tree mortality, models of urban tree distributions, and used these models to project economic losses in terms of street tree mortality due to forest pests in urban areas.

	I am currently working on using these submodels to produce heuristics for the optimal spatiotemporal management of invasive species using mixed integer linear programming.
