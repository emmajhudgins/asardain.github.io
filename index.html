	I am a PhD candidate in Brian Leung's lab at McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada. <br><br> 

I use computational methods to study the ecology,impacts, and management of invasive species at the macroecological scale. <br><br>
	
	I am interested in uncovering broad generalities that emerge across species in spite of their idiosyncrasies, as a consequence of anthropogenic processes.<br><br>
	
	My current study system is United States forest pests, where human transport (via firewood and analogous mechanisms) leads to unexpected predictive ability across all species simultaneously. <br><br>

	I have built models of invasive forest pest dispersal and establishment, urban tree distributions and pest-related tree mortality, and have used these models to project economic losses due to forest pests in urban areas.<br><br>

	I am currently working on using these submodels to produce heuristics for the optimal spatiotemporal management of invasive species using mixed integer linear programming. <br><br>
