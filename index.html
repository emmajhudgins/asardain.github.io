	I am a PhD candidate in Brian Leung's lab at McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada. <br><br> 

I use computational methods to study invasive species dispersal at the macroecological scale. <br><br>
	
	I am interested in uncovering broad generalities that emerge across species in spite of their idiosyncrasies, as a consequence of anthropogenic processes.<br><br>
	
	My current study system is United States forest pests, where human transport (via firewood and analogous mechanisms) leads to unexpected predictive ability across all species simultaneously.
